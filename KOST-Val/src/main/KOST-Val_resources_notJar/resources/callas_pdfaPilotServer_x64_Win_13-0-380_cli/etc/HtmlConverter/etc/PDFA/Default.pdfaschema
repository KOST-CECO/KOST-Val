pdfaSchema	DICOM	http://ns.adobe.com/DICOM/	DICOM	Photoshop has a set of requirements that require conversions from DICOM data types to XMP data types for the purposes of displaying information in the File Information panels. This document discusses the high-level requirements and describes in detail the proposed mapping to the XMP schema. There are many more metadata elements in DICOM that can be exposed but the list below is the ones that are relevant to Photoshop as of this date. Photoshop currently has no plans to bring a proposal in front of the DICOM committee to allow embedding of XMP in DICOM files. DICOM Date and Time within this proposal will be converted to an XMP Date for display. The Time type in the DICOM spec does not have a time zone associated with it. It will be up to the implementation to use the time zone part of the XMP Date type if they want to. DICOM types in the first table are explained in the table below it. We do not expect that changes in the DICOM spec would impact this schema. It would only add to already specified open choice elements.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T10:04:26Z	2009-06-15T10:04:26Z

pdfaType	PersonName	Person Name	http://ns.adobe.com/DICOM/	DICOM	A character string encoded using a 5 component convention. The character code 5CH (the BACKSLASH "\" in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as the delimiter between values in multiple valued data elements. The string may be padded with trailing spaces. The five components in their order of occurrence are: family name complex, given name complex, middle name, name prefix, name suffix. Any of the five components may be an empty string. The component delimiter shall be the caret "^" character (5EH). Delimiters are required for interior null components. Trailing null components and their delimiters may be omitted. Multiple entries are permitted in each component and are encoded as natural text strings, in the format preferred by the named person. This conforms to the ANSI HISPP MSDS Person Name common data type. This group of five components is referred to as a Person Name component group. For the purpose of writing names in ideographic characters and in phonetic characters, up to 3 groups of components (see Annex H examples 1 and 2) may be used. The delimiter for component groups shall be the equals character "=" (3DH). The three component groups of components in their order of occurrence are: a single-byte character representation, an ideographic representation, and a phonetic representation. Any component group may be absent, including the first component group. In this case, the person name may start with one or more "=" delimiters. Delimiters are required for interior null component groups. Trailing null component groups and their delimiters may be omitted. Precise semantics are defined for each component group. See section 6.2.1. Examples: Rev. John Robert Quincy Adams, B.A. M.Div. "Adams^John Robert Quincy^^Rev.^B.A. M.Div." [One family name; three given names; no middle name; one prefix; two suffixes.] Susan Morrison-Jones, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer "Morrison-Jones^Susan^^^Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer" [Two family names; one given name; no middle name; no prefix; two suffixes.] John Doe "Doe^John" [One family name; one given name; no middle name, prefix, or suffix. Delimiters have been omitted for the three trailing null components.] (for examples of the encoding of Person see Annex H) Notes: 1. This five component convention is also used by HL7 as defined in ASTM E-1238-91 and further specialized by the ANSI MSDS. 2. In typical American and European usage the first occurrence of "given name" would represent the "first name". The second and subsequent occurrences of the "given name" would typically be treated as a middle name(s). The "middle name" component is retained for the purpose of backward	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T10:04:26Z	2009-06-15T10:04:26Z

pdfaSchema	IPTC Core	http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpCore/1.0/xmlns/	Iptc4xmpCore	About ten years ago Adobe Systems Inc. developed the "Image Resource Block" which is a technology to wrap metadata information and to insert this packet into digital image files of various formats, e.g. Photoshop (.psd), JPEG and TIFF. To populate this abstract wrapper Adobe adopted a subset of metadata elements from the IPTC standard "Information Interchange Model - IIM", thus creating the so called "IPTC headers". In September 2001 Adobe Systems Inc. introduced its new metadata framework "Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)" and it was obvious this will make the "Image Resource Blocks" sooner or later obsolete. In March 2004 the IPTC discussed with Adobe ways for a smooth transfer of metadata values from the legacy "Image Resource Blocks" to the XMP framework. A working group was formed by the IPTC and Adobe to achieve this which was later joined by the IDEAlliance organisation as they created the DISC XMP Schema for photo metadata earlier in 2004. The working group charter was: This project is a collaborative effort of the IPTC, AdobeSystems Inc. and IDEAlliance to specify a set of news object related metadata elements for the XMP environment. Its primary intention is to allow unambiguous mapping and a smooth transfer of metadata currently held in "IPTC Headers" of digital photo image files to a new scheme of IPTC metadata. This new scheme should also reflect the additional requirements for metadata elements as they emerged since the creation of the "IPTC Headers" about ten years ago. This project aims to deliver a specification for this new IPTC metadata scheme for XMP as an XML Schema, Customized Panels for Adobe software to allow editing the metadata, and a documentation for mapping metadata back and forth between the old "IPTC Header" and the new scheme. A first set of deliveries should be made available to the public in October 2004. In October 2004 the specification of the "IPTC Core" Schema for XMP, version 1.0, was approved by IPTC members, supporting documentation was created later that year.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z

pdfaSchema	IPTC Extension	http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpExt/2008-02-29/	Iptc4xmpExt 	About ten years ago Adobe Systems Inc. developed the "Image Resource Block" which is a technology to wrap metadata information and to insert this packet into digital image files of various formats, e.g. Photoshop (.psd), JPEG and TIFF. To populate this abstract wrapper Adobe adopted a subset of metadata elements from the IPTC standard "Information Interchange Model - IIM", thus creating the so called "IPTC headers". In September 2001 Adobe Systems Inc. introduced its new metadata framework "Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)" and it was obvious this will make the "Image Resource Blocks" sooner or later obsolete. In March 2004 the IPTC discussed with Adobe ways for a smooth transfer of metadata values from the legacy "Image Resource Blocks" to the XMP framework. A working group was formed by the IPTC and Adobe to achieve this which was later joined by the IDEAlliance organisation as they created the DISC XMP Schema for photo metadata earlier in 2004. The working group charter was: This project is a collaborative effort of the IPTC, AdobeSystems Inc. and IDEAlliance to specify a set of news object related metadata elements for the XMP environment. Its primary intention is to allow unambiguous mapping and a smooth transfer of metadata currently held in "IPTC Headers" of digital photo image files to a new scheme of IPTC metadata. This new scheme should also reflect the additional requirements for metadata elements as they emerged since the creation of the "IPTC Headers" about ten years ago. This project aims to deliver a specification for this new IPTC metadata scheme for XMP as an XML Schema, Customized Panels for Adobe software to allow editing the metadata, and a documentation for mapping metadata back and forth between the old "IPTC Header" and the new scheme. A first set of deliveries should be made available to the public in October 2004. In October 2004 the specification of the "IPTC Core" Schema for XMP, version 1.0, was approved by IPTC members, supporting documentation was created later that year.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z

pdfaType	FrameCount	FrameCount	http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/1.0/DynamicMedia/	xmpDM	A number of frames at a given frame rate, which specifies an audio or video time value for a Marker (as the value of xmpDM:duration or xmpDM:startTime). Can also be used in the time portion of a document Part. The frame-count value can include the frame rate as shown. For Markers within a Track, the frame rate can be specified separately in the xmpDM:frameRate of the Track. The string value is in one of these formats: "##" For a Marker that is not in a Track, a simple integer value is interpreted as a number of seconds, at the default frame rate of 1 fps. For Markers within a Track, an integer value is interpreted as ticks/frames in the timescale specified by the track’s xmpDM:frameRate. When the count is zero, no frame rate should be specified.; "##f###" "##f###s###" A number of frames specified together with a FrameRate, which can contain an optional rate basis. The rate basis defaults to 1. These examples show how a FrameCount value of 15 is expressed for common video and audio frame rates: Film at 24 fps (frame rate = 24, rate basis = 1): "15f24" Speech-to-text in milliseconds (frame rate = 1000, rate basis = 1): "15f1000" NTSC at 29.92 fps (frame rate = 30000, rate basis = 1001): "15f30000s1001" DVATicks (frame rate = 254016000000, rate basis = 1): "15f254016000000"; "maximum" Allowed for a duration value; indicates that the time span is unlimited, or is determined automatically up to the full duration of the source.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z
pdfaType	FrameRate	FrameRate	http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/1.0/DynamicMedia/	xmpDM	A frame-rate value can be part of the FrameCount specification of a Marker. For Markers within a Track, however, the frame count can be a simple integer, and the associated frame rate is specified separately, in the xmpDM:frameRate of the Track. A frame rate is expressed as a number of frames divided by a number of seconds (f/s). The number of seconds is called the rate basis; it defaults to 1, for the common frames-per-second (fps) expression. If no frame rate is specified in either the frame count itself or in the associated track, the frame count is also the number of seconds, at the default rate of 1 fps. The string value is in one of these formats: "f###" The frame rate in frames-per-second (fps). The rate basis is assumed to be 1. For example, a frame rate of 24fps is specified as “f24”.; "f###s###" Specifies a frame rate with a rate basis. The second number is the rate basis, a number of seconds. For example, the NTSC 29.97 frame rate is specified as “f30000s1001”.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z

pdfaSchema	PLUS LDF Version 1.2.0	http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/xmp/1.0/	plus	The PLUS License Data Format ("LDF") is an ordered group of fields available for optional use in embedding and reading image license metadata in digital files and other documents. The LDF only contains information essential to the understanding of an image license. The LDF does not include other information about the image, such as captions, which can be embedded using IPTC. The LDF will be used by a broad range of licensors and licensees. It is not expected that any user will make use of the full range of fields. Each user will have full discretion in determining which fields will be used (or ignored) in that user's licensing workflow. The LDF is not a licensing interface, but is a metadata "schema" for an embedded image license. PLUS LDF will reside "under the hood" in a broad range of applications used in digital asset management, imaging and licensing, allowing users to easily access and read the license information associated with an image. In addition, PLUS LDF metadata will be accessed via PLUS "file info" panels or "property" dialogs in common applications.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z

pdfaSchema	Preflight Ticket	http://www.gwg.org/ns/gwg_preflight_v1/	gwg_preflight	In response to frequent requests for embedding a "preflight audit trail this specification describes a suggested approach. A preflight audit trail is information about a preflight check that has been carried out for the PDF at hand, and contains information about the preflight profile used as well as what the outcome of the preflight check was. For protection against tampering with both the PDF itself as well as the audit trail, a digital signature is used as defined in the PDF specification, thus avoiding proprietary techniques or algorithms. For the sake of interoperability only digital signature algorithm shall be used which are defined in the PDF 1.7 (or earlier) specification(s) and which are supported in Acrobat as of Acrobat 8. The digital signature nevertheless must comply with all requirements present in the PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3 standards. To make it easy and efficient to locate the digital signature the digital signature must be present in a signature annotation on the first page of the document. In addition, the Name field in the signature dictionary must contain the exact value Preflight Ticket Signature. This value is always the same and is used to identify the signature. It has to be taken into account though, that in the case other digital signatures are present in the PDF, only the most recent digital signature will be considered valid, unless one rolls back the PDF to the previously signed version or versions. The actual audit trail is stored as XMP inside the documents XMP metadata stream. The XMP data - using its own dedicated namespace - is embedded as a metadata stream object which is contained in the stream which is the value of the Metadata entry in the Catalog dictionary. The information in the actual audit trail consists of the following parts: human readable information about the preflight profile execution to be tracked information that allows a conforming product to determine whether a profile used for preflighting is the same as some other profile The human readable/displayable information consists of name of profile (for example Magazine Ads) software by which the profile was created (for example Adobe Acrobat Preflight) the version number of the software used for creating the profile (for example 8.0) the version number of the format in which the profile was stored (for example 1.1) result of executing the profile, with four possible values Errors, Warnings, Info or Success (for example Errors) an optional entry with descriptive text about the errors if any (actual implementation is at the discretion of the software creating the audit trail) (for example: Three errors and five warnings or Errors: More than 1 page; Font not embedded; RGB used. Warnings: Resolution of grayscale image less than 150 ppi) date and time when the profile was executed in XMP date format (for example 2007- 08-06T12:31:35+02:00) information (for example, a fingerprint or checksum) that makes it possible to determine whether the profile used is the same as some other profile (example: ff68-7293-a8ee- 524c-a9df-804f-10ae-d917): a fingerprint that cannot easily be forged; as different softwares have different way of storing profiles (for example, Preflight stores internal profiles in a different way than exported profiles) it is up to the respective software to create a fingerprint; in order to make it possible to validate the fingerprint for a profile created by a software that a user does not own (but where the user can get hold of the fingerprint of such profile from a trustworthy source) any software following the concept of this paper must have a means to display a fingerprint - in ASCII-ized/hexadecimal/ASCII85 form to make copy and paste easy - such that the user can retrieve it and share it with other users independent of the software and of the profile itself.	01000000000000000000000000000001	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z	2009-06-15T13:07:26Z
