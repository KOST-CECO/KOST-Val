ActivePerl?</a></h2>

<p>Writing extensions in C or C++ for ActivePerl is identical to writing them for standard Perl. Consult the
perlxstut document for complete information and pointers to other sources of information.</p>

<p>As a result of the oneperl effort, you no longer need to build ActivePerl from the source distribution to
write or compile extensions. The Perl installation will detect your C compiler (currently, just Visual C++),
and configure Perl to use it for compiling extensions.</p>

<p>Note that writing extensions in C or C++ is not easy. You need to have experience writing C 
programs for Windows platforms before you should even think about writing an extension.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_embed_the_Perl_interpre">How do I embed the Perl
interpreter into my C/C++ program?</a></h2>

<p>Writing applications that contain Perl interpreters using ActivePerl is
identical to writing them for standard Perl. Consult the perlembed document for
complete information and pointers to other sources of information.</p>

<p>Note that the subject of embedding Perl interpreters inside applications is
not a trivial one. You need to have experience writing C programs for Windows platforms before
you should even think about writing an embedding Perl interpreters in your application.</p>

<p>NOTE: ActivePerl 5xx series builds had a different mechanism for embedding
that was restricted to C++. This is no longer supported.
The standard way to embed interpreters now supports all the functionality that
used to be available only with C++, and then some. Use
the mechanisms described in the perlembed documentation.</p>
