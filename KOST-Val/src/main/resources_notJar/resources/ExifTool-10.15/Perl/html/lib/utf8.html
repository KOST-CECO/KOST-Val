<p>utf8 - Perl pragma to enable/disable UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) in source code</p>

<pre>
    use utf8;
    no utf8;</pre>
<pre>
    # Convert a Perl scalar to/from UTF-8.
    $num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string);

<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <code>use utf8</code> pragma tells the Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the
program text in the current lexical scope (allow UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based
platforms).  The <code>no utf8</code> pragma tells Perl to switch back to treating
the source text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.</p>
<p>This pragma is primarily a compatibility device.  Perl versions
earlier than 5.6 allowed arbitrary bytes in source code, whereas
in future we would like to standardize on the UTF-8 encoding for
source text.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that your
script is written in UTF-8.</strong> The utility functions described below are
useful for their own purposes, but they are not really part of the
``pragmatic'' effect.</p>
<p>Until UTF-8 becomes the default format for source text, either this
pragma or the <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> pragma should be used to recognize UTF-8
in the source.  When UTF-8 becomes the standard source format, this
pragma will effectively become a no-op.  For convenience in what
follows the term <em>UTF-X</em> is used to refer to UTF-8 on ASCII and ISO
Latin based platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms.</p>
<p>See also the effects of the <code>-C</code> switch and its cousin, the
<code>$ENV{PERL_UNICODE}</code>, in <a href="../lib/Pod/perlrun.html">the perlrun manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Enabling the <code>utf8</code> pragma has the following effect:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated
as being part of a literal UTF-8 character.  This includes most
literals such as identifier names, string constants, and constant
regular expression patterns.
<p>On EBCDIC platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set are
treated as being part of a literal UTF-EBCDIC character.</p>
<p></p></ul>
<p>Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script
(for example embedded Latin-1 in your string literals), <code>use utf8</code>
will be unhappy since the bytes are most probably not well-formed
UTF-8.  If you want to have such bytes and use utf8, you can disable
utf8 until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by <code>no utf8;</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to automatically upgrade your 8-bit legacy bytes to UTF-8,
use the <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> pragma instead of this pragma.  For example, if
you want to implicitly upgrade your ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) bytes to UTF-8
as used in e.g. <a href="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_chr"><code>chr()</code></a> and <code>\x{...}</code>, try this:</p>
<pre>
    use encoding &quot;latin-1&quot;;
    my $c = chr(0xc4);
    my $x = &quot;\x{c5}&quot;;</pre>
<p>In case you are wondering: yes, <code>use encoding 'utf8';</code> works much
the same as <code>use utf8;</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="utility_functions">Utility functions</a></h2>
<p>The following functions are defined in the <code>utf8::</code> package by the
Perl core.  You do not need to say <code>use utf8</code> to use these and in fact
you should not say that  unless you really want to have UTF-8 source code.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_upgrade">$num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string)</a></strong><br />
</li>
Converts (in-place) internal representation of string to Perl's
internal <em>UTF-X</em> form.  Returns the number of octets necessary to
represent the string as <em>UTF-X</em>.  Can be used to make sure that the
UTF-8 flag is on, so that <code>\w</code> or <a href="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_lc"><code>lc()</code></a> work as expected on strings
containing characters in the range 0x80-0xFF (oon ASCII and
derivatives).  Note that this should not be used to convert a legacy
byte encoding to Unicode: use Encode for that.  Affected by the
encoding pragma.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_downgrade">$success = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK])</a></strong><br />
</li>
Converts (in-place) internal representation of string to be un-encoded
bytes.  Returns true on success. On failure dies or, if the value of
FAIL_OK is true, returns false.  Can be used to make sure that the
UTF-8 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure that the <a href="../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_substr"><code>substr()</code></a>
or <a href="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_length"><code>length()</code></a> function works with the usually faster byte algorithm.
Note that this should not be used to convert Unicode back to a legacy
byte encoding: use Encode for that.  <strong>Not</strong> affected by the encoding
pragma.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_encode">utf8::encode($string)</a></strong><br />
</li>
Converts in-place the octets of the <em>$string</em> to the octet sequence
in Perl's <em>UTF-X</em> encoding.  Returns nothing.  <strong>Note that this does
not change the ``type'' of <em>$string</em> to UTF-8</strong>, and that this handles
only ISO 8859-1 (or EBCDIC) as the source character set. Therefore
this should not be used to convert a legacy 8-bit encoding to Unicode:
use Encode::decode() for that.  In the very limited case of wanting to
handle just ISO 8859-1 (or EBCDIC), you could use utf8::upgrade().
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_decode">utf8::decode($string)</a></strong><br />
</li>
Attempts to convert <em>$string</em> in-place from Perl's <em>UTF-X</em> encoding
into octets.  Returns nothing.  <strong>Note that this does not change the
``type'' of &lt;$string</strong> from UTF-8&gt;, and that this handles only ISO 8859-1
(or EBCDIC) as the destination character set.  Therefore this should
not be used to convert Unicode back to a legacy 8-bit encoding:
use Encode::encode() for that.  In the very limited case of wanting
to handle just ISO 8859-1 (or EBCDIC), you could use utf8::downgrade().
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_is_utf8">$flag = utf8::is_utf8(STRING)</a></strong><br />
</li>
(Since Perl 5.8.1)  Test whether STRING is in UTF-8.  Functionally
the same as Encode::is_utf8().
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_valid">$flag = utf8::valid(STRING)</a></strong><br />
</li>
[INTERNAL] Test whether STRING is in a consistent state regarding
UTF-8.  Will return true is well-formed UTF-8 and has the UTF-8 flag
on <strong>or</strong> if string is held as bytes (both these states are 'consistent').
Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's testsuite to check
that operations have left strings in a consistent state.  You most
probably want to use utf8::is_utf8() instead.
<p></p></ul>
<p><code>utf8::encode</code> is like <code>utf8::upgrade</code>, but the UTF8 flag is
cleared.  See <a href="../lib/Pod/perlunicode.html">the perlunicode manpage</a> for more on the UTF8 flag and the C API
functions <code>sv_utf8_upgrade</code>, <code>sv_utf8_downgrade</code>, <code>sv_utf8_encode</code>,
and <code>sv_utf8_decode</code>, which are wrapped by the Perl functions
<code>utf8::upgrade</code>, <code>utf8::downgrade</code>, <code>utf8::encode</code> and
<code>utf8::decode</code>.  Note that in the Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.1 implementation
the functions utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid, utf8::encode, utf8::decode,
utf8::upgrade, and utf8::downgrade are always available, without a
<code>require utf8</code> statement-- this may change in future releases.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or
subroutine names.  While some limited functionality towards this does
exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.</p>
<p>One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent
unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need
to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of
the filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't
portable answers.</p>
